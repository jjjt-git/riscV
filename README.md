# riscV

## summary
This is a simple RV32I-Core, I am creating as a side project parallel to my university education in computer science.

## aims
This project does not aim to be an efficient RiscV-core, but to allow me to learn about processor design.
This means, that while you are welcome to fork and modify my core, I will not merge pull-requests, as long as I activly modify it.
Issues with tips are (of course) appreciated.

## building
The Makefile is designed to be used with ghdl.
Use make run to execute all testbenches, creating ghw-files of the runs for use with gtkwave.
